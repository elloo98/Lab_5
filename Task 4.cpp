/*
What did i learn?
The use of the SDL library and ways to handle subclasses

What did I already know?
The general programming, I.E. how to set up classes, the logic behind prgramming ect.

What was difficult?
How to use the SDL library, documentation was generarly sparse and it was unintuitive to use.

How was the difficulty overcome?
A hefty amount of googleing and banging my head against the figurative wall untill something gave, luckily it was the wall in this case

How can the lab be improved?
For some reason task 2 can't render more than one of each shape and the first shape can't be a circle for some reason. I have no idea why and didn't have enough time to fix it.

How much time did you spend on the lab?
I have no idea, but I would guess more than 50 hours
