City:
	Budget is the available money
	Population is an array of persons, I.E. the population of the city
	Jobs is an array of all jobs , and by using jobs and pop you can figure out unemployment
	Resources is a catch-all term for resources that the city might need and has in storage, coal for generators, consumer goods for shops ect.
	Taxes is the tax rate of the city
	Power is the available electrical power, and seeing as no other utility is modled, is a stand-in for all utility
	Trafic is the amount of cars on the roads
	Buildings is an aray of buildings and built objects that compose the city

building:
	X_pos & Y_pos stores the position of the building
	costToBuild is the cost to build the building, might be set to free if it is just zoned land
	IsOnFire saves wether the building is on fire or not.
	GenTrafic saves how much traffic the building generates

	GeneratesNeed outputs an array describing what needs are generated by the building, things like unemployment, goods ect.
	FulfillsNeed outputs an array describing what needs the building fulfills by existing, such as jobs, education, goods
	ConsumePow removes Power when called, it is meant to simulate the need of utilities
	FireSpread checks if there are fires nearby and randomly catches the building on fire, this can also happend without fire, but rarely
	Eficiency takes happiness (from person) and the return value from genTraficIssues returns a percent modifier applied to some buildings
	GenIncome takes taxes and returns an amount to be added to balance, some buildnings are set to 0 due to them being city-owned

Residential (building):
	People stores an array of persons who live on the property

person:
	EducationLvl stores the education level of the individual
	HapinessLvl stores the happiness level of the individual
	DiseaseLvl stores the general physical and mental health level of the individual
	CrimeLvl stores the vauge concept of criminality on the part of the individual

	willMove takes the happiness level and randomly moves out (is deleted) if the value meets a threshold
	CrimeUnhappiness takes hapiness and crime and decreases happiness acordingly
	DiseaseUnhappiness takes happiness and disease and decreases happiness acordingly

Industrial (building):
	ReqEdLvl is the required Education level for working there
	SizeOfOperation is a value to reflect how many people the buisness employs and how much it produces
	Employees is an array of people employed at the building

	WillMove takes taxes and randomises wether the building is deleted
	genResources adds onto the resources
	checkEmployabl checks the employability of a person

Comercial (building):
	ReqEdLvl is the required Education level for working there
	SizeOfOperation is a value to reflect how many people the buisness employs and how much it produces
	Employees is an array of people employed at the building

	WillMove takes taxes and randomises wether the building is deleted
	sellResources deletes some resources
	checkEmployabl checks the employability of a person

Infrastructure (building):
	CostToMaintain reflects the city-owned nature of all infrastructure buildings

Education:
	Capacity is capacity
	maxEdLevel is the highest level of education you can attain from a building (You can't earn a doctorate from kindergarden)

	increaseEd increases the education of a person

Recreation:
	HappinessBoost is the amount of happiness that the facility gives (almost noone becomes extatic after a day in the park)

	ChangeHappiness adds to the happiness of a person

Powerplant:
	genPower adds to the power of the city
	genDisaster randomises wether a disaster should befall the city (labled as natural disaster)

Logistics:
	TraficCap is the capacity of the logistical network

	genTraficIssues takes TraficCap and trafic and returns a percent (sort of like an efficiency mod)

Civil service:
	canReach takes the position of another building and the cervice building and calculates wether the building should be affected

Fire Dept.:
	ExtinguishFire takes a building that is on fire and puts it out

Medical services:
	DecreaseDisease takes a person and decreases their disease level

Police:
	DecreaseCrime Takes a person and reduces their crime level

Natural Dissaster:
	Duration is the ammount of time that the disaster lasts, mostly 0

	removeBui removes buildings
	removePop kills people
	removeRes removes resources
	increaseDisease increases the disease level of a number of people
	increaseCrime increases the crime level of a number of people (this causes a bit of a weird behaviour, a nuclear meltdown could take the form of a huge crime wave,
and crime is seen as a natural dissaster when it is entirely man-made, but the randomness of natural dissasters and randomness of crime sort of fit)
	genDissaster randomises wether a dissaster should spawn or not
